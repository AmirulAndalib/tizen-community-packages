# Unwrap a zip that contains the real package.
#
# Some upstreams publish their .wgt inside a .zip release asset. Downloading
# that asset and renaming it to *.wgt produces a zip-of-a-wgt, which installs
# on nothing — and fails silently, because a .wgt is itself a zip so no glob or
# copy downstream notices. Packages in that situation set "extract" in their
# manifest and the sync workflow calls this script after the download.
#
# Usage: unwrap-zip.sh <file> <pattern>
#   file    - the downloaded file, replaced in place by the extracted entry
#   pattern - exact entry name or regex; empty/"null" makes this a no-op
#
# Never fails the caller: a wrapper that turns out not to match only warns, so
# one bad upstream cannot break the whole catalog sync.
